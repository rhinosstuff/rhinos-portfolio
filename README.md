  ## Description
  This is my 20th Challenge. In this challenge I had to create everything from scratch. I was given specific parameters to accomplish. I was to create a portfolio page implementing react single page application. I needed to have a static header and footer. The header was to have navigation links (About Me, Portfolio, Resume, Contact) that render in the same page. The footer was to have my networking links that take you to my networking profiles. I was then to deploy the working application to Netlify.
